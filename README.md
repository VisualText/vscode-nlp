## Only Computer Language Dedicated to Natural Language Processing
NLP++ is the only computer language in the world exclusively dedicated to natural language processing. It allows for creating digital human readers that use linguistic and world knowledge to parse and understand text. Whether it be for extracting or marking up "messy" text or full-blown NLP understanding, this language allows for "anything thinkable".

## NLP++ and VisualText Now Unicode

The NLP-Engine for NLP++ now works with Unicode (UTF8 via the ICU C++ Package) including the ability to work with emojis.

## Introduction

This is a VSCode Language Extension for NLP++ that recreates the functionality of [VisualText](http://visualtext.org) which has run on Microsoft Windows for the last two decades. NLP++ is a open source computer language specifically dedicated to creating text analyzers that mimic human readers and includes the NLP++ language and knowledge based system called the "conceptual grammar". NLP++ is used for any type of text processing from simple tagging or extraction, to full language parsing. There is a full english parser that is free an available for use (see information below).

The language extension and the required NLP-ENGINE run on Linux, Windows, and MacOS.

## Features

The VSCode NLP++ Language Extension allows for the fast development of NLP++ analyzers allowing users to:

* Quickly generate and edit NLP++ code
* Display the syntax tree in insightful ways
* Highlight text that has matched rules in each pass
* Display the knowledge base at strategic places in the analyzer sequence
* Easily edit and modify the pass sequence and texts to be analyze
* Display syntax errors to NLP++
* Auto generate rules
* Extensive snippets
* Help lookup

## NLP++ Example Analyzers

Example analyzers can be found in the "analyzers" folder in the NLP-ENGINE folder.

## Requirements

In order to use the VSCode NLP++ Language Extension, the NLP-ENGINE which is in the form of an executable and directory need to be present. Version one now includes this as part of the NLP language extension.

## NLP Engine Overview

The NLP-ENGINE now comes with the NLP++ Language extension but is available separately from the [VisualText github repository](https://github.com/VisualText/nlp-engine). The engine can run as a standalone executable (nlp.exe) that runs on Linux, Windows, and MacOS or it can be embedded into c++ code.

### Types of Analyzers Commonly Written Using NLP++

There are many types of analyzers that are written by NLP++ programmers including:

* Tagging of text
* Extract emails, dates, addresses, etc from unstructured text
* Entity Extraction
* Full NLP Parsing
* Sentiment analysis
* OCR Cleanup
* Extraction of data from messy text
* Autogenerate snippets from documentation

### Analyzer state.json

This file will automatically get generated when a new analyzer is created in VisualText VSCode. It is located in the .vscode directory under the folder for an individual analyzer.

    {
        "visualText": [
            {
                "name": "Analyzer",
                "type": "state",
                "currentTextFile": "/YOUR-PATH-HERE/nlp-engine/analyzers/corporate/input/Dev/Sold.txt",
                "currentPassFile": "/YOUR-PATH-HERE/nlp-engine/analyzers/corporate/spec/lookup.pat"
            }
        ]
    }

## Known Issues

There are many details in the windows version of VisualText that are yet to be implemented in the VSCode version.
